# Snow Shiny Application

The rnoaa package for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) is a great portal to download free weather data from many of the weather data collection services by NOAA.
I am a big snowboarder, so when my professor told us we could make a shiny application on anything we wanted as long as we only spend 2-3 weeks on it, I knew that writing an application to see where the most
snowfall occurs and when would be what I wanted to do. I know all of the top ski resorts and I obtained the geospatial coordinates for each of them, and rnoaa functions are able to use
these coordinates to do the rest
